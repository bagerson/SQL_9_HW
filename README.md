### COLDATA HW9 SQL

This assignment proved more challenging conceptually than technically.  While the syntax of postgresql is counterintuitive by comparison to python, the larger challege lay in grasping the relationships between the various tables in the database.

Properly mapping the behavior of the foreign/primary keys in a join operation was essential.  Once the relationships were clear, drawing the ERD made querys much more straightforward.  The clear lesson is that for a larger data set with multiple tables, diagramming the relationships _before_ will make the tasks much easier.
